// Arclo — the canonical text of the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (2026-08-24). Arclo shipped TWO different legal documents:
// a thorough pair at `web/privacy.html` / `web/terms.html`, and a much thinner
// in-app summary hand-written inside `app/legal.tsx`. The in-app one — the one
// users actually agree to and the one App Review opens — omitted analytics and
// crash reporting entirely (the app sends usage events to PostHog and crash data
// to Sentry on every session), and its Terms carried no limitation of liability
// and no governing law. Two documents for one app is a liability in itself: which
// one applies is exactly the question you do not want asked.
//
// The app now renders THIS module, so the in-app text is complete rather than a
// summary. The two HTML files under `web/` remain hand-maintained and carry a
// pointer back here — the remaining drift risk is real and is logged as a backlog
// item (generate the HTML from this module) rather than pretended away.
//
// The text below is written to be readable, not to be clever. It is not a
// substitute for counsel reviewing it once before the app has real users.
